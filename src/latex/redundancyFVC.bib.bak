  journal = {J Neurophysiol},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {83},
  pages = {1469-1479},

  abstract = {Human fingers have sufficiently more muscles than joints such that
	every fingertip force of submaximal magnitude can be produced by
	an infinite number of muscle coordination patterns. Nevertheless,
	the nervous system seems to effortlessly select muscle coordination
	patterns when sequentially producing fingertip forces of low, moderate,
	and maximal magnitude. The hypothesis of this study is that the selection
	of coordination patterns to produce submaximal forces is simplified
	by the appropriate modulation of the magnitude of a muscle coordination
	pattern capable of producing the largest expected fingertip force.
	In each of three directions, eight subjects were asked to sequentially
	produce fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude
	with their dominant forefinger. Muscle activity was described by
	fine-wire electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously collected from all
	muscles of the forefinger. A muscle coordination pattern was defined
	as the vector list of the EMG activity of each muscle. For all force
	directions, statistically significant muscle coordination patterns
	similar to those previously reported for 100\% of maximal fingertip
	forces were found for 50\% of maximal voluntary force. Furthermore
	the coordination pattern and fingertip force vector magnitudes were
	highly correlated (r > 0.88). Average coordination pattern vectors
	at 50 and 100\% of maximal force were highly correlated with each
	other, as well as with individual coordination pattern vectors in
	the ramp transitions preceding them. In contrast to this consistency
	of EMG coordination patterns, predictions using a musculoskeletal
	computer model of the forefinger show that force magnitudes =50\%
	of maximal fingertip force can be produced by coordination patterns
	drastically different from those needed for maximal force. Thus when
	modulating fingertip force magnitude across the voluntary range,
	the number of contributing muscles and the relative activity among
	them was not changed. Rather, the production of low and moderate
	forces seems to be simplified by appropriately scaling the magnitude
	of a coordination pattern capable of producing the highest force
	expected.},
