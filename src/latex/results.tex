\subsection{Activation Distribution on a  Fixed Force Vector}


\subsection{Changing Output Force in 3 Directions}
We discuss different forces into three different directions, which are given by the palmar direction ($x$-direction), the distal direction ($y$-direction) and the sum of them. The maximal forces into each direction are given by ??, ?? and ?? respectively. For $\alpha = 0.1, 0.2, \dots, 0.9$, we give the histograms where the force is $\alpha \cdot F_{\max}$, where $F_{\max}$ is the maxium output force in the corresponding direction. 

\subsection{Parallel Coordinates}
