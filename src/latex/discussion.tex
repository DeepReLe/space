\subsection{Distributions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Bounding box away from $0$ and $1$ means muscle is really needed $\rightarrow$ Already known from the bounding boxes
	\item High density $\rightarrow$ most solutions in that area
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallel Coordinates}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Parallel lines in PC indicate opposite direction of muscles
	\item Crossing lines indicate similar direction

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running Time}
The step of the algorithm which are time consuming are finding a starting point, which solves a linear program and can take exponential running time in worst case. For each fixed force vector we only have to find a starting point and an orthonormal basis once, and are hence not of concern for the running time.

Running one loop of the hit and run algorithm only needs linear time, therefore the method will extend to higher dimesions with only linear factor of additinal running time needed.
