\section{DISCUSSION}

Our results clearly show that\\
-The Hit-and-Run algorithm can explore the feasible activation space for a realistic 7-muscle finger in a way that is computationally tractable.\\
-For some muscles, we find that the bounding box exceptionally misconstrues the internal structure of the feasible activation set.\\
-The Hit-and-Run algorithm is cost-agnostic in the sense that no cost function is needed to predict the distribution of muscle activation patterns. Therefore, we can provide spatial context to where 'optimal' solutions lie within the solution space; this approach can be used to explore the consequences of different cost functions.\\
-The distribution of muscle activations often show and strong modes that will critically affect the learning of motor tasks.


In comparison to traditional bounding-box representations, our application of hit-and-run in this context is decisively superior in capability for meaningful visualization, value in extracting associations between solutions, and computational tractability, in addition to being veritable of the true solution distributions within the FAS. Our bodies exist within a feasible activation space, and once we enter this space then optimization is possible. In this way, we can think of the solutions space as an effectie model for exporation-exploitation.
This can help us in comparing the structure of the activation space as a set of high-dimensional bayesian priors which are narrowed/shifted over time to compensate for learning and skill-development.
Essentially, once you enter into task-independent variation, it becomes a question of identifying the region of the activaiton space which both satisfieds the spatiotemporal constraints, but also approaches optimality under efficiency/speed demands.
We want to 'close the loop' between the nervous system commands, and the mechanical output, thereby uncovering how the CNS collaborates with newtonian physics to select neural commands which effecitvey coordinate multi-link limbs, so we can act, play, and dance in the real world.
Mechanical demands constrain the total space of musculoskeletal coordination options, thus, motile organisms first 'explore' coordination strategies conducive to the desired movement, and recursively redefine the more optimal subspaces.
Once a desired task is mapped to an effective coordination strategy (as in, it gets the job done), then training and experience (exploration-exploitation) can aid in finding the best coordination.
As many tasks are similar (ie. they require the similar force generation or torque production over the course of a movement),  the activation patterns for simlar actions must be similar as well.
Optimal coordination strategies for one task may be near-optimal for a similar task.
On the other hand, a suboptimal coordination strategy that achieves one task, may be furiously off-target for a very similar task.
