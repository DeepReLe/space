Using Hit-and-Run to sample feasible activation sets, Figure \ref{fig:raw_histograms} shows the distributions of activation solutions for a palmar submaximal force resulting from [briantodo number] solutions computed with Hit-and-Run sampling. This is the first time (to our knowledge) that the internal structure of the feasible activation set has been visualized for a sub-maximal force.
Notice also that the lower and upper bounds of the activations (i.e., the dashed lines that indicate their bounding box), are uniquely uninformative of the actual density of distribution of feasible activations. Note also that the activation needed for the maximal force output (thick gray line) is very often not the mode of the activations at [briantodo select correct number]50\%[maytodo: can we set this as a variable and use throughout?] of output.

talk about what the bounds mean with respect to the upper and lower bounds.
Talk about the function of each muscle, with respect to the moment arm matrix and the relevant cell of the A matrix.

The density integrals perpendicular to each muscle are provably unimodal due to the convexity [maytodo cite or add supporting evidence], and therefore it would be inadvisable to fit a normal distribution as the probability density function.

\subsection{Activation spaces for increasing force} % (fold)
\label{sub:activation_spaces_for_increasing_force}
For maximal force into any direction, there is a unique activation vector satisfiying all constraint. The maximal force into palmar direction is given by ????? and its unique activation vector ????. [briantodo insert values]
In Figure \ref{fig:XY_progression} we give the distributions of the activations for increasing force, starting with $10\%$ of the maximal force, increasing in $10\%$ steps until maximal force is reached.

[1. briantodo generate pdfs as separate pages]
[briantodo write about how they are skewed, constrained, etc. Produce stats for each of the histograms and superimpose the data temporarily so you can write about it]

The solution polytope converges as the difficulty of the task increases; the rate of convergence is different across muscles. For some muscles (such as X and Y) the convergence only occurs in the last [briantodo insert maximal feasible palmar force * 0.90], while others converge earlier-in lower forces of maximal (X and Y are examples of this)[briantodo fill out these descriptive statistics].

It is imperative to keep in mind that every histogram (regardless of its convergence) is composed of the distribution of all 10,000 points; when the distribution is compressed, the relative percentage of the bars will increase, as we made break width ($\Delta x$) remain constant to 2\% of maximal contraction. [briantodo cite http://library.msri.org/books/Book31/files/ball.pdf]

The peaks seen in these figures refers to the perpendicular slice that has the largest area. %the highest number of points, and therefore has the highest volume (relative to the other parts).

\caption{Distribution of activations in the palmar direction and changing force. Each row of histograms uses a hit-and-run set. The height of each bar visualizes the percentage of 10,000 solutions found within a given 0.02 span of activation; the shape is more meaningful than the magnitude of the y axis, as we expect convergence (and therefore peak increase within few bins) towards maximal contractions.}

\subsection{Parallel Coordinates} % (fold)
\label{sub:parallel_coordinates}
briantodo: add the following figures:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{parcoord Full}
	\item{parcoord muscle limited to 75\%, then 50\%, then 25\% of its normalized maximal activation}
	\item{parcoord cost limited to 25\% of costfn1, costfn2, costfn3}
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/parcoords.pdf}
\caption{These snapshots show the use of the interactive parallel coordinate visualization of solutions across the activation space. For the task set to 50\% of maximal in the palmar direction, we show all solutions (a), remaining [N] solutions when [mX]$<$ 50\% (b), remaining [N] solutions when [mX] $<$ 25\%, remaining [N] solutions when we select the bottom 50\% across an l2 cost function, remaining [N] solutions when we select the bottom 50\% across an l2-metabolic cost function, and remaining [N] solutions when we constrain mX, mY, mZ each to below 50\%. }

discuss what happens when you bring each of those muscles down, using the R produced stats.
talk about how when you add X as a constraint, most of the solutions are distributed across the other muscles between X and X. Say which ones go up, which go down- which ones become clustered and which ones lose their peak/spike.
