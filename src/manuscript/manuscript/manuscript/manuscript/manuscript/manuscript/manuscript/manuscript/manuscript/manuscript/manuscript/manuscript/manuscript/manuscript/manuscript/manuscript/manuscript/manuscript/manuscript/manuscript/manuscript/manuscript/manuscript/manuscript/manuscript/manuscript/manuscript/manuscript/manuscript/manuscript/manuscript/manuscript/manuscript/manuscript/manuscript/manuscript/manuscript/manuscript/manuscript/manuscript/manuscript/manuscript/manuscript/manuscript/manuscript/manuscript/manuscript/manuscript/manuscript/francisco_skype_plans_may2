		Yes you could put activation constraints directly in the A matrix, instead of bounds between 0 and 1. There is no advantage to adding activation constraints beforehand in the A matrix, as sampling is uniform- as long as the resulting dataset is large enough for your purpose.
		You could also put l1 and weighted l1 cost bounds as constraints in the A matrix. Cannot put higher order cost functions such as l2,l3 or weighted l2,l3.

	Santos FVS Gusamante UCLA faculty paper: they explore histograms as a way to show the distribution- that will tell us about the "the umm specific criteria" for metropolis hastings algorithm

		show that the distribution is not uniform.
		show benefit in exploration+exploitation and baysian.





















Paper2:
